[Luke 14:28 (ESV)](# "ref")

>>>
+ Building a **tower** is for

+ To **count**: as w/pebbles,

  + "I've been stuck in **isolation** 
  + w/my family for a **month**:
+ "**Hate** my family? Check and done!" ☻
  + (turn to your neighbour!)
+ **Parallel** passage in Mt10 highlights the
  + **comparison** of strength of love:

---
Whoever loves **father** or **mother** <br>
**more** than me is not worthy of me, 

and whoever loves **son** or **daughter** <br>
**more** than me is not worthy of me.

[Matthew 10:37 (ESV)](# "ref")

>>>
+ Our usual appl: specific **times**/places
  + when God takes **centre stage**
  + in our thoughts + esp **emotions**
  + (e.g., praise + **worship**)
+ in those times we don't **think** about family,
  + **swept away** by emotion for God.
+ But not **feasible** to live like that all the time
  + so it doesn't **impact** / change daily life.
+ Sometimes, what I **love** more than God
  + is the **people** in my family:
+ e.g., **mornings** w/fam are crazy:
  + family has **urgent** + visible needs, so
+ I fail to spend **undistracted** time
  + **listening** to God.
+ Sometimes, what I **love** more than God
  + is the **ideal** of family:
+ everybody **happy** + content, communicate well,
  + **tidy** home, productive + **admired**.
+ So when it **doesn't** look like that,
  + I can't **stand** it: frustrated, bitter, angry.
+ How do I love God **and** love my family? 
+ Bible is **cohesive** whole:

[1 John 3:11,15 (ESV)](# "ref")

>>>
+ (And yes, it is the same word for **hate**)
+ So we must **hate** parents / children / sibs,
  + but **love** our brother?
+ Earthly family **comes** from God, and
  + in Christ we have **new** family of God:
+ with eternal **ties** that are even stronger
  + than the ties of our **earthly** families,
  + which "merely" last but a **lifetime**
+ We very much have **responsibilities**, each
  + to those in our own **household**.
+ e.g., 1Tim:

---
If a **widow** has **children** or grandchildren, <br>
let them first learn <br>
to show **godliness** to their **own household** <br>
and to make some **return** to their parents, <br>
for this is **pleasing** in the sight of God.

[1 Timothy 5:4 (ESV)](# "ref")

>>>
+ This is also to allow the **church**
  + to focus on **caring** for those

+ But the **commitment** of discipleship to Christ

+ Later in **Luke**, Jesus addresses those who

---
No servant can serve **two masters**,

for either he will **hate** the one <br>
and **love** the other, <br>
or he will be **devoted** to the one <br>

+ **Family** obligations and

+ Rather, our **goal** is to love God + follow Him:
  + we serve **family** as a way of serving God.
+ And **money** is also an insiduous master!
  + v33 addresses our **possessions**:

---
So therefore, any one of you <br>

[Luke 14:33 (ESV)](# "ref")

+ Money is **necessary** for life, but

+ Saying "goodbye" to **poss.** + earthly **family**
  + is all part of denying **ourselves**:
  + v26:

---
If anyone comes to me and does not **hate** ... <br>
even his **own life**, he cannot be my disciple.

[Luke 14:26 (ESV)](# "ref")

---
Whoever does not bear his own **cross**<br>
and come **after** me cannot be my **disciple**.

[Luke 14:27 (ESV)](# "ref")

>>>
+ Cross an instrument of **torture** + death
  + to **bear** own cross means
  + to be a **dead man** walking.
+ It's not just about enduring **suffering**
  + but a daily **reminder** of death:
+ I've **died** to sin + self, so
  + sin shall have no **mastery** over me!
+ I've **given up** my freedom to sin, and become
  + a **slave** to righteousness *(Rom6)*, but
+ that means I'm freed **from** sin --

+ and gained true **freedom** by the Son of God
  + in the knowledge of His **truth**! 
+ And Jesus is not **behind** us,
