## [Luke:](# "ref") the **Kingdom** of God
+ Jesus uses many **parables** to describe
  + What the kingdom of God is *like*, and
  + Who will *enter* it
+ [(14:15-24)](# "ref") Parable of the **banquet**:
  + "*Compel* people to come in, <br> that my house may be *filled*."

+ In Luke, Jesus **tells** us
  + what the **kingdom** of God is like, by
+ how He **heals** + performs miracles,
  + teaching in **parables**, and
  + His **actions** leading to the cross
+ Here the **mid-section** of Luke is
  + marked by many **parables**

Now great crowds accompanied him, <br>
and he turned and said to them,

“If anyone comes to me and does not <br>
hate his own father and mother and wife <br>
and children and brothers and sisters, <br>
yes, and even his own life,

he cannot be my disciple.

[Luke 14:25-35 (ESV) (p.1/6)](# "ref")

Whoever does not bear his own cross<br>
and come after me cannot be my disciple.

[28](# "ref")
For which of you, desiring to build a tower,<br>
does not first sit down and count the cost,<br>
whether he has enough to complete it?

[Luke 14:25-35 (ESV) (p.2/6)](# "ref")

******
[29](# "ref")
Otherwise, when he has laid a foundation<br>
and is not able to finish,

all who see it begin to mock him,
[30](# "ref")
saying,<br>
‘This man began to build <br>
and was not able to finish.’

[Luke 14:25-35 (ESV) (p.3/6)](# "ref")

[31](# "ref")
Or what king, going out<br>
to encounter another king in war,

will not sit down first and deliberate<br>
whether he is able with ten thousand <br>
to meet him who comes against him <br>
with twenty thousand?

[Luke 14:25-35 (ESV) (p.4/6)](# "ref")

[32](# "ref")
And if not, while the other<br>
is yet a great way off,

he sends a delegation <br>
and asks for terms of peace.

So therefore, any one of you <br>
who does not renounce all that he has <br>
cannot be my disciple.

+ usual appl is to have specific times/places when God takes centre stage
  in our thoughts + especially emotions (e.g., praise+worship)
  + in those times we don't think about family, are swept away by emotion for God
+ but not feasible to live like that all the time
  + so it doesn't impact/change our daily life
+ Bible is cohesive whole: love one another, but hate family/self?
  + God's love is greater than our family ties
+ don't seek Jesus as a means of seeking blessing for our families
  + serve family as a way of serving God
  + know God's love so we know what it means to truly love one another
+ e.g., "if you really loved me, you'd do .... for me"

+ hate own life != "FML": unhappy with hand that's been dealt to me
