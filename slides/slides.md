## [Luke:](# "ref") the **Kingdom** of God
+ Jesus uses many **parables** to describe
  + What the kingdom of God is *like*, and
  + Who will *enter* it
+ [(14:15-24)](# "ref") Parable of the **banquet**:
  + "*Compel* people to come in, <br> that my house may be *filled*."

+ In Luke, Jesus **tells** us
  + what the **kingdom** of God is like, by
+ how He **heals** + performs miracles,
  + teaching in **parables**, and
  + His **actions** leading to the cross
+ Here the **mid-section** of Luke is
  + marked by many **parables**

Now great crowds accompanied him, <br>
and he turned and said to them,

[26](# "ref")
“If anyone comes to me and does not hate<br>
his own father and mother and wife and children<br>
and brothers and sisters, yes, and even<br>
his own life, he cannot be my disciple.

[27](# "ref")
Whoever does not bear his own cross<br>
and come after me cannot be my disciple.

[Luke 14:25-35 (ESV) (p.1/4)](# "ref")

[28](# "ref")
For which of you, desiring to build a tower,<br>
does not first sit down and count the cost,<br>
whether he has enough to complete it?

[29](# "ref")
Otherwise, when he has laid a foundation<br>
and is not able to finish,<br>
all who see it begin to mock him,
[30](# "ref")
saying,<br>
‘This man began to build and was not able to finish.’

[Luke 14:25-35 (ESV) (p.1/4)](# "ref")

[31](# "ref")
Or what king, going out<br>
to encounter another king in war,

will not sit down first and deliberate<br>
whether he is able with ten thousand to meet<br>
him who comes against him with twenty thousand?

[32](# "ref")
And if not, while the other<br>
is yet a great way off,<br>
he sends a delegation and asks for terms of peace.

[Luke 14:25-35 (ESV) (p.1/4)](# "ref")

[33](# "ref")
So therefore, any one of you who does not<br>
renounce all that he has cannot be my disciple.

“Salt is good, but if salt has lost its taste,<br>
how shall its saltiness be restored?<br>
[35](# "ref")
It is of no use either for the soil<br>
or for the manure pile. It is thrown away.

He who has ears to hear, let him hear.”

[Luke 14:25-35 (ESV) (p.1/4)](# "ref")
