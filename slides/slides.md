## [Luke:](# "ref") the **Kingdom** of God
+ Jesus uses many **parables** to describe
  + What the kingdom of God is *like*, and
  + Who will *enter* it
+ [(14:15-24)](# "ref") Parable of the **banquet**:
  + "*Compel* people to come in, <br> that my house may be *filled*."

“If anyone comes to me and does not <br>
hate his own father and mother and wife <br>

yes, and even his own life,

he cannot be my disciple.

does not first sit down and count the cost,<br>
whether he has enough to complete it?

[Luke 14:25-35 (ESV) (p.2/6)](# "ref")

[29](# "ref")
Otherwise, when he has laid a foundation<br>

Or what king, going out<br>

And if not, while the other<br>

Now **great crowds** accompanied him, <br>
and he **turned** and said to them

[Luke 14:25 (ESV)](# "ref")

>>>
+ **Most** of the world does not care to **draw near** to Christ
+ But in times of **need**, **many** will seek Him
+ 2 weeks ago, we remembered **Palm Sunday**, when crowds shouted:

---
**Hosanna**! Blessed is he who **comes** <br>
in the name of the Lord, <br>
even the **King** of Israel!

[John 12:13 (ESV)](# "ref")

>>>
+ And yet it was many of the **same** people who,
  just a few **days** later, shouted

---
**Away** with him, away with him, **crucify** him!

[John 19:15 (ESV)](# "ref")

>>>
+ As we remembered last week on **Good Friday**
+ Their **joy** turned to **anger** because
  Jesus did not fulfill their **expectations**
+ They wanted **healing** and rescue
+ But didn't **acknowledge** what they really 
  needed **rescue** from
+ After the feeding of the **5,000**, the crowds
  **found** Jesus across the sea and **sought** him out.
  + And Jesus said to them:

---
Truly, truly, I say to you, <br>
you are **seeking me**, <br>
not because you saw **signs**, <br>
but because you ate your **fill** of the loaves.

[John 6:26 (ESV)](# "ref")

>>>
+ What they **sought** wasn't even the spectacle of the **miracle**
  + For a **sign** always points to something
+ and they weren't **interested** in following that
  to its logical conclusion
+ They had an immediate **need**, and wanted it **met**
+ This is how **we** -- **I**, too often -- pray:
+ "Lord, I am in **need**, under **stress** --
  + **fix** the problem, **satisfy** my need!"
+ It's **ironic**, bc we who are so **cavalier**
  about seeking God's **blessings**
+ are very **shrewd** when it comes to earthly **commitments**:

---
For which of you, desiring to build a **tower**,<br>
does not first **sit** down and **count** the **cost**,<br>
whether he has enough to **complete** it?

[Luke 14:28 (ESV)](# "ref")

>>>
+ Building a tower is for **protection** or **safekeeping**
  + It's a **large** + **expensive** project
+ Not sth you just **jump** into: **sit** down first
+ To **count**: as w/pebbles, to **reckon**, determine, vote
  + How much is it going to **cost** -- to consume, devour?
+ Not just how strongly you **begin**, but
  + how strongly you **finish**
+ e.g., friend asks all his friends for help **moving**: 
  + sure, group of young **guys**: how **hard** could it be? 
  + get there, see I'm the **only** one who came!
  + learned: **ask** first before committing!
+ And no matter how **private** we may like our lives to be,
  + there are always people **watching** us:

---
Otherwise, when he has laid a **foundation**<br>
and is not able to finish,

all who see it begin to **mock** him,
[30](# "ref")
saying,<br>
‘This man **began** to build <br>
and was not able to **finish**.’

[Luke 14:29-30 (ESV)](# "ref")

>>>
+ not that **fear** others' disdain, but
  + our **success** / failure is **public**
+ if I make a **bold** decision for Christ
  + but fail to **submit** my values, thinking, manner of speech, and decisions to Him
  + then my **failure** is just as well-known as my **proclamation** was
+ Where I **grew up**, there was a house whose **owner**
  + wanted to renovate it into a **castle**
  + but only made it as far as a **tower** and part of a wall
  + it stayed that way for **years**
  + everyone **knew** about it: the failed castle
+ We may be **afraid** to fail publicly, so
  + build first in **secret**
  + **reveal** only after complete
+ i.e., work on own **holiness**
  + let others **know** I'm a Christian **after**
  + my life + heart are where I **want** them to be
+ But only **tiny** towers can be built in secret
+ If I want to **follow** Christ,
  + I need to **sit** first and
  + **consider** what is involved
  + bc the **light** of Christ cannot be hidden
+ It's not only like **building** a project, but
  + like going into **war**:

---
Or what **king**, going out<br>
to encounter another king in **war**,

will not **sit** down first and **deliberate**<br>
whether he is able with **ten** thousand

to meet him who comes against him <br>
with **twenty** thousand?

[Luke 14:31 (ESV)](# "ref")

>>>
+ Before **rushing** into battle, sit down and **plan**
  + what will it take to **win**?
+ Following Christ means waging war against **sin + self**
  + not sth we just naturally **fall** into
+ We must **consciously**, intentionally, daily
  + **die** to sin + **deny** selfishness
+ It's a war we **cannot** win on our own
  + we must make **peace** with God
+ accept that we need Christ's **death**
  + to pay the **penalty** for our sin
+ **trust** Him enough to **obey** Him
  + call Him as our **Lord**
+ During this time of **crisis**,
  + it is good that we **draw near** to God
+ But as we come near to **seek** Him:

---
<!-- .slide: data-background="white" -->
# Do I seek Jesus <br> for His **blessings** <br> or His **Lordship**?

+ When I am in desperate **need**:
  + how do I **approach** Jesus?

## outline 2

>>>
+ if we **desire** to be Christ's **disciples**,
+ what does He **ask** of us?
  + what are the **prerequisites**?
+ 3 ways of describing the 1 **commitment** that is needed:
  + hate earthly **family**
  + forsake all we **possess**
  + bear our own **cross**
+ Sounds pretty **scary**!

---
“If anyone **comes** to me and does not <br>
**hate** his own father and mother and wife <br>
and children and brothers and sisters,

yes, and even his **own life**,

he cannot be my **disciple**.

[Luke 14:26 (ESV)](# "ref")

>>>
+ **hate** is a pretty strong word!
  + deep **emotion** of opposition, to despise
+ For those of us at **home**, we might say:
  + "I've been stuck at home w/my family for a **month**;
  + **hate** my family? Check and done!
+ Parallel passage in Mt10 highlights the
  + **comparison** of strength of love:

---
Whoever loves **father** or **mother** <br>
**more** than me is not worthy of me, 

and whoever loves **son** or **daughter** <br>
**more** than me is not worthy of me.

[Matthew 10:37 (ESV)](# "ref")

>>>
+ Our usual appl is to have specific **times**/places
  + when God takes **centre stage** in our 
  + thoughts + especially **emotions** (e.g., praise+worship)
+ in those times we don't **think** about family,
  + are **swept away** by emotion for God
+ but not **feasible** to live like that all the time
  + so it doesn't **impact**/change our daily life
+ Bible is **cohesive** whole:
  + Same God also commands us in 1Jn3:

---
For this is the **message** <br>
that you have heard from the beginning, <br>
that we should **love one another**

[15](# "ref")
Everyone who **hates** his brother <br>
is a **murderer**, <br>
and you know that no murderer <br>
has **eternal life** abiding in him

[1 John 3:11,15 (ESV)](# "ref")

>>>
+ (And yes, it is the same word for **hate**)
+ So we must **hate** father / mother / bro / sis
  + but **love** our brother?
+ It is God who gives us our **earthly** family
  + and in Christ we have a **new** family of God
+ with eternal **ties** that are even stronger
  + than the ties of our **earthly** families,
  + which merely last but a **lifetime**
+ We very much have **responsibilities**, each
  + to those in our own **household**:

---
If a **widow** has **children** or grandchildren, <br>
let them first learn <br>
to show **godliness** to their **own household** <br>
and to make some **return** to their parents, <br>
for this is **pleasing** in the sight of God.

[1 Timothy 5:4 (ESV)](# "ref")

>>>
+ this is also so as not to **burden** the church
  + so it can focus on **caring** for those
  + who have **none** able to care for them
+ But the **commitment** of discipleship to Christ
  + means our singular **intent**
  + is to **follow** Him
+ to subordinate every **relationship** under
  + **obedience** to His commands
+ Later in **Luke16**, Jesus addresses those who
  + treat **money** as ther master:

---
No servant can serve **two masters**,

for either he will **hate** the one <br>
and **love** the other, <br>
or he will be **devoted** to the one <br>
and **despise** the other. 

You cannot serve **God** and **money**.

[Luke 16:13 (ESV)](# "ref")

>>>
+ **Family** obligations + the desire for a **peaceful** home
  + can be just as powerfully **alluring** a master
+ Don't seek Jesus as a **means** of 
  + seeking **blessing** for our families
+ Rather, our **goal** is to love God + follow Him, and
  + we serve **family** as a way of serving God
+ And **money** is also an insiduous master!
  + v33 addresses our **possessions**:

---
So therefore, any one of you <br>
who does not **renounce** all that he **has** <br>
cannot be my **disciple**.

[Luke 14:33 (ESV)](# "ref")

>>>
+ **all he has**: not just **money** but possessions,
  + that which is **under** me, in my control
+ renounce: **order**/structure **apart** from
  + say **goodbye**
  + cf "submit": order **underneath**
+ money is **necessary** for life, but
  + does not **constitute** our life
+ **Craving** for money/possessions reflects **fear**
  + that we don't have **enough**
  + that we can't **protect** selves / loved ones
+ Remember our Heavenly **Father** 
  + provides for us **abundantly**:

---
**Fear not**, little flock, <br>
for it is your Father's good **pleasure** <br>
to give you the **kingdom**. 

[33](# "ref")
**Sell** your possessions, and **give** to the needy.

Provide yourselves with ... <br>
a **treasure** in the heavens that does not **fail**

[Luke 12:32-33 (ESV)](# "ref")

>>>
+ not that **owning** things is **evil**
  + but **separate** the person from the possessions
+ **Use** the material blessings God gave us
  + to show **mercy** on those in need --
+ it's the best long-term **investment** strategy!
+ Saying "goodbye" to **possessions** + earthly **family**
  + is all a part of renouncing **ourselves**:

---
If anyone comes to me and does not **hate** ... <br>
even his **own life**, he cannot be my disciple.<br>

[Luke 14:26 (ESV)](# "ref")

>>>
+ **hating** own life != feeling "my life **sucks**":
  + i.e., **unhappy** with hand that's been dealt to me
+ and != **despising** the gift of life God gave us
  + or **deliberately** getting COVID:
  + that **harms** others!
+ in v27, Jesus uses the image of the **cross**:

---
Whoever does not bear his own **cross**<br>
and come **after** me cannot be my **disciple**.

[Luke 14:27 (ESV)](# "ref")

>>>
+ Cross an instrument of **torture** + death
  + to **bear** own cross: 
  + to be a **dead man** walking
+ It's not just about enduring **suffering**
  + but a **reminder** of death:
+ Sin shall have no **mastery** over me, bc
  + I've **died** to it, done and gone!
  + I don't **desire** to live in sin any longer
+ As we're **carrying** that reminder of death daily,
  + remember where **Jesus** is:
  + in **front** of us, clearing the way!
+ He's gone **before** in bearing the **suffering** of sin
  + and He's already **triumphed** over sin + grave
+ So, as 2Cor says, in this world we are always
  + both **dead** and **alive**:

---
always **carrying** in the body the **death** of Jesus, <br>
so that the **life** of Jesus <br>
may also be **manifested** in our bodies. 

[11](# "ref")
For we who live are always being <br>
given over to **death** for Jesus' sake, 

so that the **life** of Jesus also <br>
may be manifested in our mortal flesh

[2 Corinthians 4:10-11 (ESV)](# "ref")

>>>
+ Never **tire** of the msg of the **cross**
+ reminds us that in our **struggle** w/sin
+ Christ has already **died** for us
  + that we would be **dead** to sin
+ And He is **risen**, risen indeed
  + that we may manifest **life** that overcomes

---
<!-- .slide: data-background="white" -->
# What does it mean to **bear** my own **cross**?

>>>
+ To **love** God with all our **heart** / life / strength
+ means finding **stronger** bonds in the HS
  + than our **earthly** family ties
+ It means saying **"goodbye"** to all we have
  + separating our **possessions** 
  + from who we are as a **person** in Christ
+ It means **remembering** every day
  + that through Christ we are **dead** to sin
  + we no longer live for **ourselves**
  + but for **Christ** who gives us new life

>>>
+ at this point, some **listeners** may say,
+ "You ask **too much**! I've already

+ "I have very real, immediate **stresses**
  + I need to **deal** with right now.

+ If you're **asking** that, you're **not** alone!
+ Jesus, after asking the **rich young man**

  + and **give** to the poor,
+ Jesus himself attested:

---
It is easier for a **camel** <br>
to go through the eye of a **needle**

than for a **rich** person <br>
to enter the **kingdom of God**.

[26](# "ref")
And they were exceedingly **astonished**, <br>
and said to him, “Then **who** can be saved?” 

[Mark 10:25-26 (ESV)](# "ref")

---
Jesus looked at them and said, 

“With **man** it is impossible, <br>
but not with **God**. 

For all things are **possible** with God.”

[Mark 10:27 (ESV)](# "ref")

>>>
+ This does **not** mean God will do anything we **want**
+ but the **ability** to **follow** Him as His disciple,

+ all these are **gifts** given as **God** enables

---
And he said, “This is why I told you <br>
that no one can **come** to me <br>
unless it is **granted** him by the **Father**.”

[John 6:65 (ESV)](# "ref")

>>>
+ Jesus said this after another **call** to commitment
+ and many followers **left** Him after this:
  + "It's **too hard** to do,
  + Who is able even to **listen** to it?"
+ But the twelve **disciples** stayed, why?

So Jesus said to the twelve, <br>
“Do **you** want to go away as well?”
