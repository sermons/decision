## [Luke:](# "ref") The **Kingdom** of God

  + What the kingdom of God is *like*, and

+ 3 things to **take away** from this passage:
+ (1) 2 **analogies** Jesus uses to prompt us to
  + check our **expectations**
  + as we draw **near** to Him:
  + **why** are we seeking Him?
+ (2) 3x Jesus says "this is a **requirement**"
  + you **must** do this to be My **disciple**
+ (3) Jesus says to those He's **chosen**:
  + this is **who you are**
  + **live** like it!
+ Starting in **v25**, we're no longer in
  + the **dinner** at Pharisee's house,

>>>
+ **Most** of the world does not care

  + **many** will seek Him.
+ 2 weeks ago, we remembered
  + **Palm Sunday**, when crowds shouted:

---
**Hosanna**! Blessed is he who **comes** <br>
in the name of the Lord, <br>
even the **King** of Israel!

[John 12:13 (ESV)](# "ref")

+ And **yet**, it was many of

**Away** with him, away with him, **crucify** him!

[John 19:15 (ESV)](# "ref")

>>>
+ ... as we remember last wk on **Good Fri**
+ Their **joy** turned to **anger** because
  + Jesus did not fulfill **expectations**.
+ They did want **healing** + rescue,
  + but didn't **ack** what they really
  + needed **rescue** from.
+ After feeding of **5,000**,
  + the crowds **found** Jesus

+ And Jesus said to them:

---
Truly, truly, I say to you, <br>
you are **seeking me**, <br>
not because you saw **signs**, <br>
but because you ate your **fill** of the loaves.

[John 6:26 (ESV)](# "ref")

>>>
+ What they **sought** wasn't even
  + the spectacle of the **miracle**:
+ bc a sign always **points** to sth,
  + and they weren't **interested**
  + in the **implications** of the sign.
+ They had an immediate **need**,
  + and wanted it **met**
+ This is how **we** -- **I** -- often pray:

For which of you, desiring to build a **tower**,<br>
does not first **sit** down and **count** the **cost**,<br>
whether he has enough to **complete** it?

[Luke 14:28 (ESV)](# "ref")

>>>
+ Building a **tower** is for
  + **protection** or **safekeeping**:
+ It's a **large** + **expensive** project,
  + not sth you just **jump** into:
  + **sit** down first, plan
+ To **count**: as w/pebbles,
  + to **reckon**, determine, vote
+ How much is it going to **cost** -- 
  + to **consume**, devour?
+ e.g., back in **single** days:
  + friend asks all friends to help **move**:
+ ☻ sure, group of young **guys**:
  + how **hard** could it be?
+ day of: I'm the **only** one who showed!
  + learned: **ask** first before commit!
+ if I know how to **plan**
  + before committing to **projects**,
+ why should I think committing to **Christ**
  + is any **different**?
+ Not just how strongly I **begin**, but
  + how strongly I **finish** 
+ And no matter how **private**
  + we may **like** our lives to be,
+ there are always people **watching** us:

Otherwise, when he has laid a **foundation**<br>
and is not able to finish,

all who see it begin to **mock** him,

‘This man **began** to build <br>
and was not able to **finish**.’

[Luke 14:29-30 (ESV)](# "ref")

>>>
+ not that we **fear** others' disdain, but
  + our **success** / failure is **public**:
+ if I make a **bold** decision for Christ, but
  + fail to **submit** values, thinking,
  + manner of **speech**, decisions to Him,
+ then my **failure** will be as well-known
  + as my **proclamation** was
+ e.g., where I **grew up**, there was
  + a house whose **owner**
  + wanted to renovate it into a **castle**:
+ but only did a **tower**, part of a wall
  + stayed that way for **years**
+ everyone **knew** it: the **failed** castle
+ We, working on our own **holiness**,
  + may be **afraid** to fail publicly, so
  + build tower first in **secret**, then
+ once life + heart where I **want** them,
  + **reveal** the completed tower: tada! 
+ But only **tiny** towers can built secret
  + and the **light** of the **glory** 
  + of Christ cannot be **hidden**.
+ The 2nd analogy is going into **war**:

---
Or what **king**, going out<br>
to encounter another king in **war**,

will not **sit** down first and **deliberate**<br>
whether he is able with **ten** thousand

to meet him who comes against him <br>
with **twenty** thousand?

[Luke 14:31 (ESV)](# "ref")

>>>
+ Before **rushing** into battle,
  + sit down and **plan**:
  + what will it take to **win**?
+ Following Christ means
  + waging war against **sin + self**:
  + not sth we just naturally **fall** into
+ We must **conscious**, intent, daily
  + **die** to sin + **deny** selfishness
+ It's a war we **cannot** win on our own
  + we must make **peace** with God
+ ack we need Christ's **death**
  + to pay the **penalty** for our sin
  + hence win the **victory** over it.
+ Must **trust** Him enough to **obey** Him
  + call Him as our **Lord**.
+ During this time of **crisis**,
  + it is good that we **draw near** to God

If anyone **comes** to me and does not <br>
**hate** his own father and mother and wife <br>
and children and brothers and sisters,

yes, and even his **own life**,

he cannot be my **disciple**.

[Luke 14:26 (ESV)](# "ref")

>>>
+ **hate** is a pretty strong word!
  + deep **emotion** of opposition,
  + to **despise**, abhor
+ ☻ Those of us at **home** might say:
  + "I've been stuck in **isolation** 
  + w/my family for a **month**:
+ "**Hate** my family? Check and done!" ☻
  + (turn to your neighbour!)
+ **Parallel** passage in Mt10 highlights the
  + **comparison** of strength of love:

---
Whoever loves **father** or **mother** <br>
**more** than me is not worthy of me, 

and whoever loves **son** or **daughter** <br>
**more** than me is not worthy of me.

[Matthew 10:37 (ESV)](# "ref")

>>>
+ Our usual appl: specific **times**/places
  + when God takes **centre stage**
  + in our thoughts + esp **emotions**
  + (e.g., praise + **worship**)
+ then we don't **think** about family,
  + **swept away** by emotion for God.
+ But not **feasible** to live that all time
  + so no **impact** / change daily life.
+ Sometimes, what I **love** more than God
  + is the **people** in my family:
+ e.g., **mornings** w/fam are crazy:
  + family has **urgent** + visible needs, so
+ I fail to spend **undistracted** time
  + **listening** to God.
+ Sometimes, what I **love** more than God
  + is the **ideal** of family:
+ everybody **happy** + content, **comm.** well,
  + **tidy** home, productive + **admired**.
+ So when it **doesn't** look like that, I
  + can't **stand** it: frustr, bitter, angry.
+ How do I love God **and** love my family? 
+ Bible is **cohesive** whole:
  + the **same** God commands in 1Jn:

For this is the **message** <br>
that you have heard from the beginning, <br>
that we should **love one another**

[15](# "ref")
Everyone who **hates** his brother <br>
is a **murderer**, <br>
and you know that no murderer <br>
has **eternal life** abiding in him

[1 John 3:11,15 (ESV)](# "ref")

>>>
+ (And yes, it is the same word for **hate**)
+ So **hate** parents / children / sibs,
  + but **love** our brother?
+ Earthly family **comes** from God, and
  + in Christ we have **new** family of God:
+ with eternal **ties** that are even stronger
  + than the ties of our **earthly** families,
  + which "merely" last but a **lifetime**
+ We very much have **responsib**, each
  + to those in our own **household**.
+ e.g., 1Tim:

---
If a **widow** has **children** or grandchildren, <br>
let them first learn <br>
to show **godliness** to their **own household** <br>
and to make some **return** to their parents, <br>
for this is **pleasing** in the sight of God.

[1 Timothy 5:4 (ESV)](# "ref")

>>>
+ This is also to allow the **church**
  + to focus on **caring** for those who
  + don't have **anyone** caring for them.
+ But **commitment** of discip to Christ
  + means our singular **intent**
  + is to **follow** Him:
+ so subord every **relationship** under
  + **obedience** to His commands
+ Later in **Luke**, Jesus addresses those
  + who treat **money** as ther master:

---
No servant can serve **two masters**,

for either he will **hate** the one <br>
and **love** the other, <br>
or he will be **devoted** to the one <br>
and **despise** the other. 

You cannot serve **God** and **money**.

[Luke 16:13 (ESV)](# "ref")

>>>
+ **Family** obligations and

+ Don't seek Jesus as a **means** of 
  + seeking **blessing** for our families;
+ Rather, our **goal** is 
  + to **love** God + follow Him:
  + serve **family** as way of serving God.
+ And **money** is also an insiduous master!
  + v33 addresses our **possessions**:

---
So therefore, any one of you <br>
who does not **renounce** all that he **has** <br>
cannot be my **disciple**.

[Luke 14:33 (ESV)](# "ref")

+ "all he has": not just money but **poss.**:
  + **under** me, in my control
+ "renounce": **order** / struct **apart** from,
  + say **goodbye**
  + cf "submit": order **underneath**.
+ Money is **necessary** for life, but
  + does not **constitute** our life
+ **Clinging** to possessions reflects **fear**
  + that we don't have **enough**, that we

  + but **separate** the person

+ **Use** the material blessings God gave us
  + to show **mercy** on those in need --

+ Saying "goodbye" to **possessions**
  + and earthly **family**
+ is all part of denying **ourselves**: v26:

---
If anyone comes to me and does not **hate** ... <br>
even his **own life**, he cannot be my disciple.

[Luke 14:26 (ESV)](# "ref")

>>>
+ **hate** own life != feel "my life **sucks**":

Whoever does not bear his own **cross**<br>
and come **after** me cannot be my **disciple**.

[Luke 14:27 (ESV)](# "ref")

>>>
+ Cross an instrument of **torture** + death
  + to **bear** own cross means
  + to be a **dead man** walking.
+ It's not just about enduring **suffering**
  + but a daily **reminder** of death:
+ I've **died** to sin + self, so
  + sin shall have no **mastery** over me!
+ I've **given up** my freedom to sin, and

+ but that means I'm freed **from** sin --

+ &amp; gained true **freedom** by Son of God
  + in the knowledge of His **truth**.
+ And Jesus is not **behind** us,
  + driving us as a **slave master**;
+ He's gone **before** bearing **suff** of sin

+ So in this world we're always

So we do not **lose heart**. 

Though our **outer self** is wasting away, <br>
our **inner self** is being **renewed** day by day.

but the things that are unseen are **eternal**.
