## [Luke:](# "ref") the **Kingdom** of God
+ Jesus uses many **parables** to describe
  + What the kingdom of God is *like*, and
  + Who will *enter* it
+ [(14:15-24)](# "ref") Parable of the **banquet**:
  + "*Compel* people to come in, <br> that my house may be *filled*."

+ In Luke, Jesus **tells** us
  + what the **kingdom** of God is like, by
+ how He **heals** + performs miracles,
  + teaching in **parables**, and
  + His **actions** leading to the cross
+ Here the **mid-section** of Luke is
  + marked by many **parables**

******
[25](# "ref")
Now great crowds accompanied him, <br>
and he turned and said to them,

[26](# "ref")
“If anyone comes to me and does not hate<br>
his own father and mother and wife and children<br>
and brothers and sisters, yes, and even<br>
his own life, he cannot be my disciple.

[27](# "ref")
Whoever does not bear his own cross<br>
and come after me cannot be my disciple.

[Luke 14:25-35 (ESV) (p.1/4)](# "ref")

******
[28](# "ref")
For which of you, desiring to build a tower,<br>
does not first sit down and count the cost,<br>
whether he has enough to complete it?

[29](# "ref")
Otherwise, when he has laid a foundation<br>
and is not able to finish,<br>
all who see it begin to mock him,
[30](# "ref")
saying,<br>
‘This man began to build and was not able to finish.’

[Luke 14:25-35 (ESV) (p.1/4)](# "ref")

******
[31](# "ref")
Or what king, going out<br>
to encounter another king in war,

will not sit down first and deliberate<br>
whether he is able with ten thousand to meet<br>
him who comes against him with twenty thousand?

[32](# "ref")
And if not, while the other<br>
is yet a great way off,<br>
he sends a delegation and asks for terms of peace.

[Luke 14:25-35 (ESV) (p.1/4)](# "ref")

******
[33](# "ref")
So therefore, any one of you who does not<br>
renounce all that he has cannot be my disciple.

[34](# "ref")
“Salt is good, but if salt has lost its taste,<br>
how shall its saltiness be restored?<br>
[35](# "ref")
It is of no use either for the soil<br>
or for the manure pile. It is thrown away.

He who has ears to hear, let him hear.”

[Luke 14:25-35 (ESV) (p.1/4)](# "ref")

+ Jn6:26 seek Jesus not bc signs but bc ate/filled
+ Lk16: men of this age more shrewd with own
  + so Jesus uses parables/analogies

---

>>>
+ count: w/pebbles, reckon, determine, vote
  + cost: consume, devour
+ e.g., friend asks for help moving: how hard could it be? 
  + halfway through moving, want to give up
+ make fun: e.g., "castle" on MI
+ not that fear others' disdain, but
  + failure is public
+ we may be afraid to fail, so
  + build first in secret
  + i.e., work on own holiness
  + reveal only after complete
+ but only tiny towers can be built in secret
+ commitment to Christ: know what is involved
  + because it can't be hidden

---

>>>
+ before rushing into battle, sit down and plan
  + what will it take to win?
+ following christ means waging war against sin+self
  + a war we cannot win on our own

>>>
+ 1Jn3:11 love one another
  + 15 hate bro == murder

+ usual appl is to have specific times/places when God takes centre stage
  in our thoughts + especially emotions (e.g., praise+worship)
  + in those times we don't think about family, are swept away by emotion for God
+ but not feasible to live like that all the time
  + so it doesn't impact/change our daily life
+ Bible is cohesive whole: love one another, but hate family/self?
  + God's love is greater than our family ties
+ don't seek Jesus as a means of seeking blessing for our families
  + serve family as a way of serving God
  + know God's love so we know what it means to truly love one another
+ e.g., "if you really loved me, you'd do .... for me"

+ hate own life != "FML": unhappy with hand that's been dealt to me
  + and != deliberately get COVID: harms others!
+ Mt10:37-39, John 12:25: lose/find life

+ Lk16:13 God, money: no 2 masters: love one, hate other

---

>>>
+ renounce: order/structure apart from: say goodbye
  + cf submit: order underneath

>>>
+ Christ hadn't died yet, what would hearers have thought of
+ 2Cor4:10 carry in body death of Jesus
  + 7-9 jars of clay, ... struck down but not destroyed
  + 16 outer self decaying / inner self renewed

+ high cost: who then can be saved? Lk18:26-30

+ Lk15: "sinners", lost sheep, lost coin, lost son:

  + those who know they need saving
